# Data-Processing-and-Storage
By: Reece McDonald
Instructions for running code
1. Clone repository
2. Move .h and .cpp file into whatever project file you're working with, C++ exclusive.
3. Include DB.h within your main file.
4. Instantiating an object of the new class type, use "DB", as that is what I named the object type.

Changes to be made for later implementation into a full assignment:
1. I think that maybe specifying that you're mimicking a database and not actually creating one would be nice, not necessary because I caught on quickly, but I definitely thought I was going to be using SQL code at first.
2. Maybe have the given test function calls and their specified outputs be a test suite? Either a test suite you provide to the students, a test suite the graders would use too to make that easier, or have the students implement unit tests with those specified parameters and expected outputs.
3. Maybe a more obvious thing that a student should just know, but since intro to software eng. isn't a pre-requisite of this class, maybe specify that the students are meant to upload their code and README to a github repository, and the visibility to set it to. I don't even know what visibility it is supposed to be, public or private. So specify making a github repository and if it should be public or not.
